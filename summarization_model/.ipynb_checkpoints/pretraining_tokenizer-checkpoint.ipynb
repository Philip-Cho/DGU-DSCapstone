       " \"Canavan's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by aspartoacylase deficiency. The deficiency of aspartoacylase leads to increased concentration of N-acetylaspartic acid in brain and body fluids. The failure to hydrolyze N-acetylaspartic acid causes disruption of myelin, resulting in spongy degeneration of the white matter of the brain. The clinical features of the disease are hypotonia in early life, which changes to spasticity, macrocephaly, head lag, and progressive severe mental retardation. Although Canavan's disease is panethnic, it is most prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Research at the molecular level led to the cloning of the gene for aspartoacylase and development of a knockout mouse for Canavan's disease. These developments have afforded new tools for research in the attempts to understand the pathophysiology of Canavan's disease, design new therapies, and explore methods for gene transfer to the central nervous system.

       " 'Polychlorobiphenyl (PCB) degradation usually occurs through reductive dechlorination under anaerobic conditions and phenolic ring cleavage under aerobic conditions. In this paper, we provide evidence of nitrate reductase (NaR) mediated dechlorination of hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153) in Phanerochaete chrysosporium under non-ligninolytic condition and the gene involved. The NaR enzyme and its cofactor, molybdenum (Mo), were found to mediate reductive dechlorination of PCBs even in aerobic condition. Tungsten (W), a competitive inhibitor of this enzyme, was found to suppress this dechlorination. Chlorine release assay provided further evidence of this nitrate reductase mediated dechlorination. Commercially available pure NaR enzyme from Aspergillus was used to confirm these results. Through homology search using TBLASTN program, NaR gene was identified, primers were designed and the RT-PCR product was sequenced. The NaR gene was then annotated in the P. chrysosporium genome (GenBank accession no. AY700576). This is the first report regarding the presence of nitrate reductase gene in this fungus with the explanation why this fungus can dechlorinate PCBs even in aerobic condition. These fungal inoculums are used commercially as pellets in sawdust for enhanced bioremediation of PCBs at the risk of depleting soil nitrates. Hence, the addition of nitrates to the pellets will reduce this risk as well as enhance its activity.',\n",

       " 'Traffic congestion has greatly affected not only the nation’s economy and environment but also every citizen’s quality of life. A recent study shows that every American traveler spent an extra 38 hours and 26 gallons of fuel per year due to traffic congestion during the peak period. Of this congestion, 10% is attributable to improper operations of traffic signals. Surprisingly, more than a half of all signalized intersections in the United States need to be re-optimized immediately to maintain peak efficiency. Even though many traffic signal control systems have been upgraded from pre-timed controllers to actuated and adaptive controllers, the traffic signal optimization software has not been kept current. For example, existing commercial traffic signal timing optimization programs including SYNCHRO and TRANSYT-7F do not optimize advanced controller settings available in the modern traffic controllers including minimum green time, extension time, and detector settings. This is in part because existing programs are based on macroscopic simulation tools that do not explicitly consider individual vehicular movements. To overcome such a shortcoming, a stochastic optimization method (SOM) was proposed and successfully applied to a signalized corridor in Northern Virginia. This study presents enhancements made in the SOM and case study results from an arterial network consisting of 16 signalized intersections. The proposed method employs a distributed computing environment (DCE) for faster computation time and uses a shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA) for better optimization. The case study results showed that the proposed enhanced SOM method, called SFLASOM, improved the total network travel times over field settings by 3.5% for Mid-Day and 2.1% for PM-Peak. In addition, corridor travel times were improved by 2.3% to 17.9% over field settings. However, when the new SOM timing plan was compared to the new field timing plan implemented in July 2008, the improvements were marginal, showing slightly over 2% reductions in individual vehicular delay.',\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVE\\nThe purpose of this article is to investigate a noninvasive method for quantifying diffuse myocardial fibrosis with cardiac MRI in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\\n\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nWe performed cardiac MRI on 35 patients (24 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 11 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) and 10 control subjects, on a clinical 1.5-T cardiac MRI scanner. Delayed hyperenhancement images were obtained 15 minutes after injection of a bolus of gadopentetate dimeglumine (0.2 mmol/kg), to identify fibrosis using an inversion recovery gradient-echo technique (inversion time scout sequence: TR, 20.8 milliseconds; TE, 1.3 milliseconds; inversion time, individually determined to null the myocardial signal [range, 85-800 milliseconds]). An inversion time mapping sequence was used to calculate the contrast-enhanced myocardial inversion time at the null point of a single midventricular slice as an index of diffuse fibrosis.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nThe mean contrast-enhanced myocardial inversion time at the null point was significantly shorter in the patient group than the control group (343. 7 +/- 27.9 vs 390.4 +/- 19.3 milliseconds; p < 0.0001). In the patient group, the mean contrast-enhanced myocardial inversion time at the null point was shorter in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy than in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (337.0 +/- 29.6 vs 358.6 +/- 17.1 milliseconds, p = 0.02). In the dilated cardiomyopathy group, contrast-enhanced myocardial inversion time at the null point was significantly related to the left ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0.52; p = 0.01). However, in the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy group, contrast-enhanced myocardial inversion time at the null point had only a small positive correlation with the left ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0.27; p = 0.41).\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nContrast-enhanced myocardial inversion time at the null point is shorter with myocardial fibrosis in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In dilated cardiomyopathy, contrast-enhanced myocardial inversion time at the null point is inversely related to the severity of dilated cardiomyopathy.',\n",
       " 'Numerical analysis of the hyperelastic behavior of polymer materials has drawn significant interest from within the field of mechanical engineering. Currently, hyperelastic models based on the energy density function, such as the Neo‐Hookean, Mooney‐Rivlin, and Ogden models, are used to investigate the hyperelastic responses of materials. Conventionally, constants relating to materials were determined from experimental data by using global least‐squares fitting. However, formulating a constitutive equation to capture the complex behavior of hyperelastic materials was difficult owing to the limitations of the analytical model and experimental data. This study addresses these limitations by using a system of neural networks (NNs) to design a data‐driven surrogate model without a specific function formula, and employs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to calculate the massive amount of combined loading data of hyperelastic materials. Thus, MD simulations were used to propose an NN constitutive model for hyperelasticity to derive the constitutive equation to model the complex hyperelastic response. In addition, the probability distributions of the numerical solutions of hyperelasticity are used to characterize the uncertainty of the MD models. These statistical finite element results not only present numerical results with reliability ranges but also scattered distributions of the solution obtained from the MD‐based probability distributions.',\n",
       " 'The effect of vector potential on the phase of a quantum wavefunction was brought out fifty years ago, and is termed as AharonovBohm (AB) effect [1]. The effect is described in terms of the shift in the interference pattern created by a charged particle moving outside a solenoid or flux line. In a remarkable experiment, this effect was experimentally verified in precise quantitative terms [2]. There is an enormous literature on basic questions and effects related to this effect (see e.g. [3]). Yang has unified electromagnetic and gravitational AB effects [4]. As quoted in a recent article [5], “Aharonov stresses that the arguments that led o the prediction of the various electromagnetic AB effects apply well to any gauge-invariant quantum theory. In the standard model of particle physics, the strong and weak nuclear interactions are also described by gauge-invariant theories.” This work presents AB effect presented in the ground state of deuteron, thus it might well be called “nuclear AB effect”. The work is based on the study of ground state wavefunction of deuteron to O(~) which, in principle, can be extended to all orders [6]. Beginning with the coupled equations describing the S1 state, u(r) and D1 state, w(r) [7], it was shown that Hamiltonian for the deuteron may be written as',\n",

The inability to detect consistently IL-10 in maternal serum in normal and complicated pregnancies, despite using highly sensitive assays, suggests that the potential use of IL-10 as a clinical diagnostic marker in pregnancy should be approached with caution.',\n",

       " 'Mobile Computing System is a distributed system where one of the processes is known as Mobile Node. The Mobile Computing System have some limitations such as Low Bandwidth of wireless network, lack of stable storage, mobility handling, disconnection of mobile nodes (MNs) and limited battery life., In this paper we have analyzed various handoff schemes / algorithms. As we know movement based scheme takes a checkpoint only after a threshold, when mobility handoffs has been exceeded. The main issue regarding wireless and mobile computing technology is handoff, because of limited coverage of mobile support station (MSS). When a mobile node (MN) moves from current MSS to another MSS, then it needs to perform a handoff. This results in data loss and communication interruption. Many researchers worked to minimize this problem but it still remains a matter of research. In this paper, we suggest that AODV protocol is among the effective solution of the handoff failures in movement based asynchronous mobile computing environment.',\n",

While rural to urban migration and urbanization have proceeded apace in Malaysia, the kampung continues to play an important role in the lives of the country's Malay community and in Malaysia's national cultural geography. This article examines the place of the kampung in that cultural geography as it is related in the narratives of return migrants to the kampung of Sungai Siputeh in northern peninsular Malaysia. The article argues that return migrants are existentially engaged in fashioning their own lives in relationship to this discourse as they move between rural and urban spaces. Moreover, within rural Malaysia, their narratives shape the cultural geography of rural subjects. Anthropologists are abandoning villages in Southeast Asia and around the world.

       " 'This study was aimed to devise a theoretical formula for the mid-age of incidence (MAI) from the prevalence of age groups and to confirm its application. The formula was devised using the concept of lost years of health and then simulated. In the inhabitants’ survey, MAI was calculated from the prevalence of liver disease in the areas, and the main cause of disease was analyzed between those areas where MAI was lower than 2.5% of the distribution with significantly high prevalence (HL group) and those areas where MAI was higher than 2.5% of the distribution with significantly high prevalence (HU group). In the computer simulation, MAI was not much different or a little lower than the mid-age of occurrence. In addition, the sum of the incidence rates in the 1-year age groups approximately corresponded to the maximum prevalence within the age groups in the simulation. In the HL group, the main cause of liver disease was alcoholic liver injury; in the HU group, one cause was type C hepatitis, whereas for many others, it was advanced alcoholic liver injury. Thus, the HU and t HL groups were confirmed as active and quiescent areas, respectively. Investigating the cause or stage is considered to be useful in future studies. \\n \\n \\xa0 \\n \\n Key words: Mid-age of incidence (MAI), Lost years of health, chronic disease, prevalence, age specific prevalence.',\n",

       " 'In this work we made teeth ablation experiments using a laser microprocessing set-up coupled with an amplified femtosecond laser system with 200 fs pulse duration. The experiments were performed at different laser fluences, from 0.21 J/cm2 up to 64 J/cm2. Structures with computer controlled geometries were created as single round craters, large square craters shapes, and parallel lines. Irradiation was made in single-pulse, multi-pulse, and quasi-continuous (2 kHz) mode at different laser scanning speeds. Characterization of ablated structures was made by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Ablation areas images show crystalline and regular structures. There are not evidences of material burning under 64 J/cm2. Generated structures are reproducible, dependent on dental quality. Enamel ablation threshold under 3 J/cm2 was measured. Dimensions of the ablated structures are of tens of micrometers, depending on beam fluence, focusing optics, and material hardness. When a 10x microscope objective was used, craters with about 5-7 micrometers were obtained. Better resolution of the structures can be obtained down to about 1 micron, however more difficult is to observe and work with such ablated structures. Femtosecond laser ablation demonstrates to be a promising method for teeth treatment due to its advantages: ablation precision and no collateral damages.',\n",

       " 'Alan Bennett 1934—English playwright. Guidelines are in the air. There are guidelines now for nearly everything including HCT. Although guidelines can be very useful the ‘law of unintended consequences’ may come into play. Guidelines should be short and should clearly explain that they cannot cover all clinical situations and are merely to help in coming to a rational decision. They are certainly useful in planning strategy. For example, we decided, a number of years ago, to carry out five allogeneic HCT for renal cell carcinoma and evaluate the results. Following evaluation, we stopped. I should confess to taking part in the publication of a 20-page guideline for the investigation and treatment of a certain syndrome. Useless. Perhaps a chapter in a book but definitely not a guideline. A recent example is ASH guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: prophylaxis for hospitalised and nonhospitalised patients [1]. This guideline was 20 pages long, contained 174 references and concluded: the limitations of these guidelines are inherent in the low or very low certainty in the evidence we identified for many of the questions! A prominent surgeon in Ireland told me that in his view the next generation of doctors will be unable to make a clinical decision without consulting guidelines. Unfortunately, members of the judiciary in some countries, do not seem to understand this and think that guidelines are rules which cannot be broken. Could it be that guidelines stymie the ability to think clearly? A colleague (she is head of a large HCT unit) said recently that while on a ward round with her staff she encountered a critically ill post HCT patient. Turning to her staff, she asked: ‘what would you do’? The answer from all staff members came loudly and clearly: ‘consult the guidelines’, ‘discuss the case at the next MDT’ (multidisciplinary conference)’. These were trainees in a large university teaching hospital! My colleague believed that a decision needed to be made immediately and that the answer would probably not be found in the guidelines. In Henry Hemmings book ‘Our Man in New York’: ‘Charles Lindberg (not everyone’s favourite person) was quoted as saying; ‘forming committees was one of the greatest of American fallacies’ [2]. Serendipity and common sense are two expressions that doctors do not like but we would not have penicillin or the discovery of Helicobacter Pylori as a cause of peptic ulcer disease/gastric cancer without serendipity. Some people [2] believe that observational databases combined with expert opinion provide reliable and effective ways of determining effective new therapies in the HCT setting. Some people also believe that evidence is objective. Of course, it is subjective and depends on the way it is collected and presented. Otherwise the world would not need lawyers. The diagnosis and treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease is a good example of the very limited value of guidelines. In the 2019 EBMT handbook [3] Holler, Greinix and Zeiser say that: ‘so far no single agent has shown superiority of results when combined with corticosteroids for first line treatment of acute Graft versus Host Disease (aGvHD)’ yet many different approaches to the treatment of aGvHD are found in established HCT units. In a recent interview [4] Professor James Ferrara said: ‘we need a simpler system of grading and staging of GvHD. It was so confusing that we asked our pathologists to stop grading the biopsies’. So, there are many clinical situations in HCT units in which the decisions reached will vary between hospitals, and guidelines, if they exist, are of little value. What about wine making? Yes, there are recommendations but there are many variations in fermentation strategies, from the use of cement, stainless steel, wood, and more latterly the use of the cement ‘egg’.

       " 'Background: Endogenous internal controls (‘reference’ or ‘housekeeping’ genes) are widely used in real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analyses. Their use relies on the premise of consistently stable expression across studied experimental conditions. Unfortunately, none of these controls fulfills this premise across a wide range of experimental conditions; consequently, none of them can be recommended for universal use. Methods: To determine which endogenous RT-PCR controls are suitable for analyses of renal tissues altered by kidney disease, we studied the expression of 16 commonly used ‘reference genes’ in 7 mildly and 7 severely affected whole kidney tissues from a well-characterized cystic kidney disease model. Expression levels of these 16 genes, determined by TaqMan® RT-PCR analyses and Affymetrix GeneChip® arrays, were normalized and tested for overall variance and equivalence of the means. Results: Both statistical approaches and both TaqMan- and GeneChip-based methods converged on 3 out of the 4 top-ranked genes (Ppia, Gapdh and Pgk1) that had the most constant expression levels across the studied phenotypes. Conclusion: A combination of the top-ranked genes will provide a suitable endogenous internal control for similar studies of kidney tissues across a wide range of disease severity.',\n",

Los ensayos de composicion, quimicos y mineralogicos, de resistencia mecanica a flexion y a compresion se han llevado a cabo a 3, 7 28, 91, 182 y 365 dias. Se han evaluado diversos factores que afectan al comportamiento mecanico: Tiempo de curado, dosificacion, caracteristicas del arido y porosidad. Los morteros de cal aerea precisan largos periodos para exhibir sus maximas resistencias. Una mayor proporcion de conglomerante genera mejores resistencias y un aumento paralelo de la porosidad, hasta el limite de 2:1. Los aridos de naturaleza caliza, de machaqueo, han ofrecido los mejores comportamientos mecanicos. La estructura porosa del material, estudiada por porosimetria de intrusion de mercurio, se ha correlacionado con las resistencias, de manera que una fase continua de matriz, junto con un mejor acceso de CO2 al sistema, ha contribuido a incremento de resistencia. En cales hidraulicas, el comportamiento es analogo aunque las cifras son mas altas: En las primeras fases el mortero fragua rapidamente por la hidratacion de C3S. Despues se estabiliza a edades intermedias, y edades avanzadas las resistencias repuntan por la carbonatacion y por la hidratacion de C2S.

       " 'Presented herein is a procedure for arriving at an optimal design of a homogeneous earth dam laid on an impervious foundation and provided with a drain. The procedure, heavily dependent on variably saturated flow modeling, involves optimizing a multiobjective function comprising a weighted summation of four objective functions, viz., the dam section area, seepage discharge, wetted area of the dam section and the drain area. The design variables considered in the optimization are the upstream and downstream slopes and the drain dimensions. The optimization is carried out subject to the constraints ensuring safe upstream and downstream slopes and sufficient distance between the free surface and the downstream face. Two of the objective functions (viz., the seepage discharge and the wetted area) and the constraints are implicit functions of the design variables. Their values are obtained by employing a numerical model of two-dimensional (vertical plane) variably saturated flow in a homogeneous earth dam. Optimization, conducted by the sequential unconstrained minimization technique procedure is preceded by several runs of the model for various combinations of the design variables. The discrete values of the implicit functions so generated are invoked during optimization to compute the implicit objective functions and constraints. The results are presented in the form of nondimensional design tables/curves. The design procedure is illustrated with the help of few examples.',\n",

In the present study, we further characterized the pharmacological profile of GPD-1116 in several experiments in vitro and in vivo. GPD-1116 and its metabolite GPD-1133 predominantly inhibited not only human PDE4, but also human PDE1 in vitro. Moreover, GPD-1116 was effective in several disease models in animals, including acute lung injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and pulmonary hypertension; the effective doses of GPD-1116 were estimated to be 0.3-2\\u2009mg/kg in these models. With regard to undesirable effects known as class effects of PDE4 inhibitors, GPD-1116 showed suppression of gastric emptying in rats and induction of emesis in dogs, but showed no such suppression of rectal temperature in rats, and these side effects of GPD-1116 seemed to be less potent than those of roflumilast. These results suggested that GPD-1116 could be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammatory pulmonary diseases.

       " 'Acrolein-derived DNA adducts of guanine have previously been detected in tissues of several species, including humans, and have been shown to be mutagenic in mammalian cells and potentially carcinogenic in higher organisms. In duplex DNA, the predominant acrolein-derived lesion, gamma-hydroxy-1,N2-propanodeoxyguanosine (gamma-HOPdG), exists in an equilibrated mixture of ring-opened and ring-closed forms. We have previously shown that the acyclic form can undergo secondary chemical reactions to form both interstrand DNA-DNA cross-links in a CpG sequence context and DNA-protein and DNA-peptide cross-links. Investigations using duplex DNAs containing gamma-HOPdG in a CpG sequence context reversibly created at least two cross-linked species: an imine, which is a minor species but could be readily reduced by NaBH4, and a major heat labile, nonreducible species that we formulate as a carbinolamine cross-link. The DNA came to equilibrium over several days with the carbinolamine species being significantly more abundant than the reducible imine. In an effort to find other types of DNA-DNA cross-links, we have developed a high throughput screen to evaluate the effects of DNA sequence and lesion structure on the formation of reducible interstrand and intrastrand cross-links. These data reveal that four different lesions, two involving deoxyguanosine and two involving deoxyadenosine, can react with nearby bases to form inter- and intrastrand DNA cross-links.',\n",

       " 'On the non-autoimmune C57BL/6 (B6) background, the chromosome 7-derived lupus susceptibility loci Sle3 and Sle5 have been shown to mediate an elevated CD4:CD8 ratio with an increase in activated CD4+ T cells, decreased susceptibility to apoptosis, and a break in humoral tolerance. Development of subcongenic strains has subsequently shown that the elevated CD4:CD8 ratio is due to Sle3 but that both loci contribute to the development of autoantibodies. To elucidate the functional expression patterns of these loci, adoptive transfer experiments were conducted. All possible combinations of bone marrow reconstitution, including syngenic, were conducted between the congenic B6 and B6.Sle3/5 strains. It was found that the Sle3/5 locus was functionally expressed by bone marrow-derived cells, but not by host cells, and that the elevated CD4:CD8 phenotype could be reconstituted in radiation chimeras. Using Ly5-marked congenic strains and B6 host mice, additional experiments surprisingly demonstrated that the elevated CD4:CD8 ratio was neither an intrinsic property of the T cells nor of single positive thymocytes. Allotype-marked chimeras indicated that autoantibody production by B cells was also an extrinsic property, as shown by the fact that B cells without the Sle3/5 interval contributed to autoantibody production. These experiments strongly suggest that a gene within the B6.Sle3/5 interval was expressed by a bone marrow-derived, nonlymphocyte population in the thymus and periphery and was affecting T cell selection and/or survival.',\n",
       " 'YbjN, encoding an enterobacteria-specific protein, is a multicopy suppressor of temperature sensitivity in the ts9 mutant strain of Escherichia coli. In this study, we further explored the role(s) of ybjN. First, we demonstrated that the ybjN transcript was about 10-fold lower in the ts9 strain compared to that of E. coli strain BW25113 (BW). Introduction of multiple copies of ybjN in the ts9 strain resulted in over-expression of ybjN by about 10-fold as compared to that of BW. These results suggested that temperature sensitivity of the ts9 mutant of E. coli may be related to expression levels of ybjN. Characterization of E. coli ybjN mutant revealed that ybjN mutation resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes, including increased motility, fimbriation (auto-aggregation), exopolysaccharide production, and biofilm formation. In contrast, over-expression of ybjN (in terms of multiple copies) resulted in reduced motility, fimbriation, exopolysaccharide production, biofilm formation and acid resistance. In addition, our results indicate that a ybjN-homolog gene from Erwinia amylovora, a plant enterobacterial pathogen, is functionally conserved with that of E. coli, suggesting similar evolution of the YbjN family proteins in enterobacteria. A microarray study revealed that the expression level of ybjN was inversely correlated with the expression of flagellar, fimbrial and acid resistance genes. Over-expression of ybjN significantly down-regulated genes involved in citric acid cycle, glycolysis, the glyoxylate shunt, oxidative phosphorylation, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism. Furthermore, over-expression of ybjN up-regulated toxin-antitoxin modules, the SOS response pathway, cold shock and starvation induced transporter genes. Collectively, these results suggest that YbjN may play important roles in regulating bacterial multicellular behavior, metabolism, and survival under stress conditions in E. coli. These results also suggest that ybjN over-expression-related temperature rescue of the ts9 mutant may be due to down-regulation of metabolic activity and activation of stress response genes in the ts9 mutant.',\n",

       " 'This thesis explores the impacts of new transit infrastructure projects on the land use transportation system. Land use and transportation systems are inherently interconnected and form an integrated system; and transport projects affect not just the transportation system, but also land use patterns. Current evaluation frameworks and models applied to new transport infrastructure projects usually focus on transportation system improvements, and so do not reflect the process of land use transportation interaction. To overcome this limitation, this thesis argues that the evaluation of transport projects should consider their accessibility and development impacts; and that this requires models which explicitly incorporate the interaction between land use and transportation. The Circle Line in Chicago is a proposed circumferential rail transit line which will serve the urban core of the Chicago region, and is likely to significantly affect both land use and travel patterns. This thesis assesses how existing models can be used to quantify the accessibility and development impacts of this project; and how an existing evaluation framework, developed by the Federal Transit Administration, considers these impacts. In addition, this thesis develops a quasi-integrated land use transportation model for the Chicago region; and applies it to quantify the accessibility and development impacts of the Circle Line project. The frameworks and models developed for the Circle Line project provide an example of how to improve the current FTA evaluation methodology. Thesis Supervisor: P.

       " 'The Queensway folds are an anticline–syncline pair in layered limestone and shale of the Ottawa Formation in the Ottawa – St. Lawrence Lowlands. They are parallel, flexural-slip folds with horizontal axes trending northwest, parallel to the surface trace of the Gloucester fault.Five principal fracture subpatterns were recognized in the fold-pair, caused by at least four geometrically distinct stress fields. The principal stress directions at failure for all five subpatterns coincided, moreover, with the three orthogonal fabric axes, and the maximum principal stress was either parallel or perpendicular to the fold axes and to the Gloucester fault.Slickenside striae on bedding and on fractures at an angle to bedding indicate two principal kinematic patterns in the fold-pair; the one arises from motion in the deformation plane as a consequence of the folding and the other from strike-slip motion perpendicular to that plane as a consequence of displacement on the Gloucester fault.Slickensides indicate that each bed was free to move relative to adjacent ones during folding and that the fundamental structural unit in flexural-slip folding is the bed. Model studies support the field data and indicate that the sense and magnitude of interbed slip in any structural position is dependent upon an integral of conditions throughout the fold-pair and that the fundamental fold unit is the anticline–syncline pair.',\n",
       " 'Development of space rocketry and cosmic instrument making has made it possible to create interplanetary stations to be sent to the solar system bodies. In the last decade of the century the planet Mars will be in the focus of planetary science problems. Russia, USA (the NASA) and Europe (the ESA) plan to do a new step in the study of the planetary system by spacecraft missions to Mars. One part of the programs of these missions is Martian surface measurements of iron, which is a dominant element in both the Martian soil and rocks (about 13 percent by weight). The chemistry of iron in space is strongly coupled to the chemistry of abundant elements (to begin with hydrogen, carbon, oxygen) and it is this coupling of chemical cycles of abundant elements that gives us the possibility of understanding some features of the chemical evolution of matter. In this connection of extremely great importance for the understanding of the evolution of the solar system are the oxidation state of the iron and its mineral composition of the Mars surface. Being highly successful, the Viking landers had no instrumentation to answer these questions. Such instrumentation has to be specifically sensitive to mineralogy. For this purpose the back scattering Moessbauer spectrometer (MS-96) was proposed to be installed on a rover to be launched on board the Russian spacecraft Mars-96 mission to Mars. Due to power and mass restrictions three systems of the device MS-96 (velocity transducer, detector and electronic components) have been extremely miniaturized in comparison to a standard system. In this paper we intend to place for consideration a radioactive source to find out what characteristics it should have to be suitable for purposes of the experiment.',\n",
       " 'The enhanced high gain harmonic generation (EHGHG) scheme has been proposed and shown to be able to significantly enhance the performance of HGHG FEL. In this paper we investigate the EHGHG scheme with negative dispersion. The bunching factor at the entrance of the radiator is analyzed, which indicates that the scheme with negative dispersion can further weaken the negative effect of the dispersive strength on the energy spread correction factor. The numerical results from GENESIS (3D-code) are presented, and are in good agreement with our analysis. Then we comparatively study the effects of the initial beam energy spread and the relative phase shift on the radiation power. The results show that the EHGHG scheme with negative dispersion has a larger tolerance on the initial beam energy spread and a nearly equal wide good region of the relative phase shift compared with the case of positive dispersion.',\n",

       " 'Abstract Following landscape change, species invasions and extinctions may lead to biotic homogenisation, resulting in increased taxonomic and functional similarity between previously distinct biotas. Biotic homogenisation is more likely to occur in landscapes where the matrix contrasts strongly with native vegetation patches. To test this, we examined the distribution of ground-active beetles in a landscape of remnant Eucalyptus open woodland patches where large areas of lower contrast matrix (farmland) are being transformed to high-contrast pine plantations in south-eastern Australia. We sampled beetles from 30 sites including six replicates of five categories; (1) remnants adjacent to farmland, (2) remnants adjacent to plantation, (3) farmland, (4) plantation, and, (5) remnants between pine plantation and farmland. Community composition in the pine matrix was similar to native patches embedded in pine (ANOSIM, Global R \\xa0=\\xa00.49, P F \\xa0=\\xa09.049, df\\xa0=\\xa025, P F \\xa0=\\xa05.875, df\\xa0=\\xa025, P \\xa0=\\xa00.002), even compared to native remnant patches. Our results suggest that matrix transformations can reduce species richness and homogenise within-patch populations. This may increase the risk of species declines in fragmented landscapes where plantations are not only replacing native vegetation patches, but also other matrix types that may better support biodiversity. Our findings are particularly concerning given expanding plantation establishment worldwide.',\n",
       " 'In many near surface geophysical applications it is now common praxis to collect co-located disparate geophysical data sets. The advantage of such multi-method based exploration strategies lies in its potential to reduce ambiguities and uncertainties in data analysis and interpretation. To reconstruct the physical parameter distributions underlying geophysical data requires in many cases the application of tomographic reconstruction techniques. To improve the reliability of tomographically reconstructed physical parameter models, the information content of all co-located data sets should be considered during the model-generation process. Here, we apply a novel approach based on fuzzy c-means cluster analysis and conventional single-input data set inversion algorithms for the cooperative inversion of crosshole seismic P-wave and S-wave traveltimes. The approach results in a single zoned two-parameter model outlining the major subsurface units and provides additionally P-wave and S-wave velocity fields.',\n",
